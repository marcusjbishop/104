\begin{questions}
\question A {\em top line} is a roulette bet,
only available in the US, on any of the spaces labeled by
$0,00,1,2,3$. The payout for a $\$1$~top line bet
is $\$6$.
\footnote{Note that this is an {\bf exception} to the
payout rule $\frac{36}{n}-1$.}
Calculate the expectation on a $\$1$~top line bet.
Round your answer to the nearest cent.\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\$0$
\choice $-\$0.01$
\choice $-\$0.03$ % expectation for other bets in Europe
\choice $-\$0.05$ % expectation for other bets in US
\correctchoice $-\$0.08$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question A {\em first dozen} is a roulette bet
on any of the spaces labeled by $1,2,\ldots,12$. What are the
{\bf odds against} a first dozen bet in the US?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $2:1$ % the payout
\choice $12:1$ % the number from stem
\choice $3:1$ % the approxomate probability of winning
\correctchoice $13:6$
\choice $19:1$ % the expectation
\end{oneparchoices}

\question A tetrahedral die has four sides labeled $1,2,3,4$.
If an experiment consists of rolling four such dice, how
many outcomes are in the sample space of the experiment?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $4$ % faces on one die
\choice $8$
\choice $16$ % number of faces
\choice $64$ % three instead of four dice
\correctchoice $256$
\end{oneparchoices}

\uplevel{Questions~\ref{FirstPresident}--\ref{LastPresident}
deal with the student council.
Alex, Brooke, Colby, and Denise comprise the student
council. They want to select a president and
a vice president from among themselves. However,
Alex and Denise cannot serve together in these roles
because they are married to each other.}

\question\label{FirstPresident}
How many possible choices of president and vice president are there?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $5$ % number of combinations
\correctchoice $10$
\choice $11$ % only eliminated one A/D
\choice $12$ % 3 by 4
\choice $14$ % replaced
\end{oneparchoices}

\question
What is the probability that Brooke will be chosen
as either president or vice president?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{2}{5}$ % counted second branch as 1
\correctchoice $\frac{3}{5}$
\choice $\frac{1}{2}$ % heuristic, or didn't eliminate A/D
\choice $\frac{7}{16}$ % replaced and didn't eliminate A/D
\choice $\frac{5}{16}$ % replaced 
\end{oneparchoices}

\question
% A good distractor here would be 3, counting
% Alex's president branch once instead of twice
% Some students were looking for this answer choice
In how many choices does Alex appear as either president
or vice president?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice $4$
\choice $5$ % heuristic, half the choices
\choice $6$ % didn't eliminate A/D
\choice $7$
\choice $8$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question\label{LastPresident}
What is the probability that Denise will be selected
as vice president?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice $\frac{1}{5}$
\choice $\frac{1}{4}$ % replaced and didn't eliminate A/D
\choice $\frac{3}{10}$ % didn't eliminate A/D
\choice $\frac{3}{16}$ % replaced 
\choice $\frac{1}{2}$ % heuristic
\end{oneparchoices}

\uplevel{Questions~\ref{FirstDice}--\ref{LastDice}
involve the experiment of rolling two regular
six-sided dice.}

\question\label{FirstDice}
How many outcomes are in the sample space of the experiment?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $6$ % one die
\choice $11$ % possible sums of two dice
\choice $12$ % add rather than multiply
\choice $18$
\correctchoice $36$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question What is the probability that both dice show five?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{1}{30}$ % replaced, although impossible
\correctchoice $\frac{1}{36}$
\choice $\frac{1}{12}$ % took 12 to be size of sample space
\choice $\frac{1}{6}$
\choice $\frac{1}{5}$ % number from stem
\end{oneparchoices}

\question\label{LastDice}
What is the probability that at least one die shows five?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{1}{36}$
\choice $\frac{1}{6}$
\choice $\frac{1}{5}$ % number from stem
\correctchoice $\frac{11}{36}$
\choice $\frac{25}{36}$ % complement
\end{oneparchoices}
