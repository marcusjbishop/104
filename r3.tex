\maketitle
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Do exercises~43--57 of the Review Exercises
on page 97~of your textbook.
The answers to all these exercises are in the
back of the book on page~104.

\item This exercise concerns the game of craps.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability of throwing a craps? That is, what is
the probability of rolling a sum of 2, 3, or 12 on two dice?
\item What is the probability of rolling a sum of~10 on two dice?
\item Suppose you roll a sum of 10 on your initial craps roll.
At this stage, what is the probability that you will win the game?
\item What is the probability of rolling a sum of~10 on the initial
roll {\bf and} subsequently winning the game?
\end{enumerate}

\item
Two cards are drawn at random from a deck of playing cards
without replacement.
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that both cards have suit
$\heartsuit$?
\item What is the probability that the second card has
suit $\heartsuit$
given that the first card has suit $\diamondsuit$?
\item What is the probability that the second card has
suit $\heartsuit$
and the first card has suit $\diamondsuit$?
\end{enumerate}

\item The following table shows the number
of respondents to the American Community
Survey living in Iowa over the past 12~months, 
organized by race and foodstamp usage (SNAP).
\[\begin{array}{l|rr|r}
&\text{Received SNAP}&\text{Didn't receive SNAP}
&\text{Total}\\\hline
\text{White}&115,248&1,037,390&1,152,638\\
\text{African American}&12,360&18,056&30,416\\

\text{Total}&137,317&1,089,230&1,226,547
\end{array}\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item How many respondents received food stamps over the
past 12~months?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected
respondent did not receive food stamps given that
the respondent is Asian?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected
respondent is white given that the respondent
received food stamps?
\item How many respondents received food stamps and
are not white?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected
respondent was of several races?
\item How many African American respondents received
food stamps?
\item What is the probability that a randomly selected
respondent received food stamps?
