\begin{questions}
\question Ames High School has
$156$ students in band and $34$
students in both band and chorus.
If $1089$ of the $1422$ students at Ames High
are in neither band nor chorus, how many students
are in chorus?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $122$ % just band
\choice $177$ % just chorus
\choice $211$ % correct
\choice $333$ % number in music
\choice $933$ % took 1089 to be number in music
\end{oneparchoices}

\question Suppose $E$ and $F$ are events.
Suppose also that $P\left(E\right)=0.75$,
$P\left(\text{$E$ and $F$}\right)=0.55$
and $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)=0.85$. What
is $P\left(F\right)$?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $0.10$
\choice $0.20$
\choice $0.45$
\choice $0.65$
\choice $0.85$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question A tetrahedral die has four sides labeled $1,2,3,4$.
If an experiment consists of rolling four such dice, how
many outcomes are in the sample space of the experiment?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $4$ % faces on one die
\choice $8$
\choice $16$ % number of faces
\choice $64$ % three instead of four dice
\choice $256$ % correct
\end{oneparchoices}

\uplevel{Questions~\ref{FirstPresident}--\ref{LastPresident}
deal with the student council.
Alex, Brooke, Colby, and Denise comprise the student
council. They want to select a president and

How many possible choices of president and vice president are there?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $4$ % only made one choice
\choice $10$ % correct
\choice $11$ % only eliminated one A/D
\choice $12$ % 3 by 4
\choice $14$ % replaced
\choice $16$ replaced and failed to eliminate A/D
\end{oneparchoices}

\question
What is the probability that Brooke will be chosen
as either president or vice president?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice
\end{oneparchoices}
\choice $2/5$ % counted second branch as 1
\choice $3/5$ % correct
\choice $7/16$ % replaced
\end{oneparchoices}

\question\label{LastPresident}
In how many choices does Alex appear as either president
or vice president?

\uplevel{Questions~\ref{FirstDice}--\ref{LastDice}
involve the experiment of rolling two regular
six-sided dice.}
\question\label{FirstDice}
How many outcomes are in the sample space of the experiment?
\question What is the probability that both dice show six?
\question\label{LastDice}
What is the probability that at least one die shows six?
\end{questions}
