\begin{solution}{\vfill}
$10\cdot 26\cdot 26\cdot 26\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 10=26^3\cdot 10^4

\question[16] Two cards are drawn at random from a deck of playing cards
without replacement.
\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability that the second card is a Queen
given that the first card is a Queen?
\begin{solution}[1in]
$\frac{3}{51}\approx 0.059$
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that both cards are Queens?
\begin{solution}[1in]
$\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}
\approx 0.005$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[18] The following table lists
the languages other than English spoken by residents
of Iowa between 2008 and 2012, organized by the age
of the resident.\footnote{Source: {\tt www.census.gov}}
\[\begin{array}{r|rrr|r}
\text{Language}&\text{$5$--$17$}
&\text{$18$--$64$}&\ge 65&\text{Total}\\\hline
\text{Spanish or Spanish Creole}&32,196&75,674&4,114&111,984\\
\text{Other Indo-European}&8,978&29,811&6,530&45,319\\

\text{Total}&49,184&140,381&13,322&202,887

\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability that a randomly selected
resident spoke Spanish or Spanish Creole
given that that individual was between $65$ years old or older?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
$\frac{4114}{13322}\approx 0.309$
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly selected
resident that spoke a language other than English
was between $18$ and $64$ years old?
\begin{solution}[2cm]
$\frac{140381}{202887}\approx 0.692$
\end{solution}
\part How many residents of age $65$ or older
spoke a language other than English?
\begin{solution}[2cm]

\question[24] In a recent survey of 884 Americans between the ages
of $18$ and $50$, $120$ reported that they have tattoos,
$72$ have body piercings, and $41$ have both.
\footnote{2004, American Journal of Dermatology}

\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a tattoo?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
$\frac{120}{884}\approx 0.136$
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a piercing?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
$\frac{72}{884}\approx 0.081$
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a both a tattoo and a piercing?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
$\frac{41}{884}\approx 0.056$
\end{solution}
\part\label{Independent} According to this data do
the decision to get a piercing and the decision
to get a tattoo appear to be independent?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
No, since $0.136\cdot 0.081\approx 0.011\ne 0.056$
\end{solution}
\part Does your response to part~(\ref{Independent}) make
sense in the context of the problem?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
We'll accept anything along the lines of people with
tattos being more inclinded to get piercings or vice versa.
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a tattoo given that that individual
has a piercing?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
$\begin{xy}<.5cm,0cm>:
(-1,2)*+!D{\text{T}};
(1,2)*+!D{\text{P}};
(-1,0)*\cir<1cm>{};
(1,0)*\cir<1cm>{};
(0,0)*{41};
(-2,0)*{79};
(2,0)*{31};
(4,0)*{733};
\end{xy}$
\qquad $\frac{41}{72}\approx 0.569$
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a piercing given that that individual
does {\bf not} have a tattoo?
\begin{solution}[1.5cm]
$\frac{31}{31+733}\approx 0.041$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[16] How many anagrams of the word
\textsf{Tintinnabulation} are there?
\begin{solution}[3in]
The number of times each distinct letter appears is
shown in the following table.
\[\begin{array}{r|cccccccc}
\text{letter}&a&b&i&l&n&o&t&u\\\hline
\text{frequency}&2&1&3&1&4&1&3&1
\end{array}\]
Thus the number of anagrams is
\[\frac{16!}{2!3!4!3!}=12,108,096,000.\]
\end{solution}

\question[16] Suppose $E=\left\{r,t,u,v,w\right\}$,
$F=\left\{s,t,x,y,z\right\}$, and $G=\left\{r,s,v,y,z\right\}$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $\left(E\cup G\right)\cap\left(F\cup G\right)$
\begin{solution}[1.5in]
\begin{align*}
E\cup G&=\left\{r,s,t,u,v,w,y,z\right\}\\
F\cup G&=\left\{r,s,t,v,x,y,z\right\}\\
\text{so}\quad
\left(E\cup G\right)\cap\left(F\cup G\right)
&=\left\{r,s,t,v,y,z\right\}\\
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\part Calculate $\left(E\cap F\right)\cup G$
\begin{solution}
\begin{align*}
E\cap F&=\left\{t\right\}\\
\text{so}\quad\left(E\cap F\right)\cup G
&=\left\{r,s,t,v,y,z\right\}
