\begin{questions}

\question[10] Two dice are rolled and the
numbers on the top faces of the two dice are observed.
Determine the odds against each of the following events.
\begin{parts}
\part Both numbers are the same.
\vspace{.25in}
\part The sum of the two numbers is $5$.
\vspace{.25in}
\part The sum of the two numbers is even.
\vspace{.25in}
\part At least one of the numbers is $3$.
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part Can occur in $6$ ways, so $30:6$ or $5:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $4$ ways, so $32:4$ or $8:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $18$ ways, so $18:18$ or $1:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $11$ ways, so $25:11$ the odds against
\end{parts}
\end{solution}

\question[10]
\begin{multicols}{2}
When dropping a thumbtack, it either lands point down
or point up, as shown in the image at the right.
You drop all the thumbtacks in a box on the floor, observing that
$105$~tacks land point down while $35$ land point up.
Based on these results, if you drop two thumbtacks, what
is the probability that both tacks will land point up?
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{Thumbtacks}
\end{multicols}
\begin{solution}
$\frac{35}{35+105}=\frac{1}{4}$ the empirical probability
of point up, so $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^2=\frac{1}{16}$
the probability of both points up.
\end{solution}

\question[10] A game is played as follows.
Two coins are flipped. If both coins come up
heads, then you win $\$2$. If both coins come
up tails, then you win $\$3$. 
Otherwise you lose $\$4$. What are your expected proceeds
of this game?
\begin{solution}
$2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)+3\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)
-4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=-\frac{3}{4}=-0.75$
\end{solution}

\question[10] Suppose $E$ and $F$ are events
and $P\left(E\right)=.75$ and $P\left(F\right)=.25$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming that $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive.
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ and $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\end{parts}

\question Ames High School has $1422$ students.
If $102$ students in band but not chorus and
$176$ students in chorus but not band.
If $1093$ students are in neither band nor chorus,
then how many students are in both band and chorus?

\question[10] Your itinerary for Saturday should
include a trip to Target, Staples, Hy-Vee, and the bank.
However, since Target is across the street from Staples,
you should visit those two stores consecutively. In other
words, Target should be right after Staples, or else
Staples should be right after Target. In how many ways
can you plan your itinerary?

\question[10] If two cards are randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards without replacement, what is the probability that both cards
will be picture cards?  A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King.

\question[10] To raise money the volleyball team sells 500~raffle tickets
for $\$3$ each. They will randomly select a ticket holder to receive
a prize. If the fair ticket price is $0.30$, how much is the prize?
