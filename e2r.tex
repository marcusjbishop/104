\question[10]
\begin{multicols}{2}
When dropping a thumbtack, it either lands point down
or point up, as shown in the image at the right.
Alex drops all the thumbtacks in a box on the floor.
$106$~tacks land point down, while $35$ land point up.
Based on these results, if he drops two thumbtacks, what
is the probability that both tacks will land point up?

\question[10] Suppose $E$ and $F$ are events
and $P\left(E\right)=.75$ and $P\left(F\right)=.25$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming that $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive.
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ and $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\end{parts}
