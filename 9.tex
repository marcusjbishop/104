\begin{question}
How many finishes among first $3$~places
can occur in $8$-horse race (excluding ties)?
\end{question}
\begin{question}
How many different foursomes can be formed
from among $7$~golfers?
\end{question}
\begin{question}
How many different $13$-card bridge hands are there?
\end{question}
\begin{question}
How many different ways to arrange a particular $13$-card
bridge hand?
\end{question}

\begin{frame}
\begin{question}
How many finishes among first $3$~places
can occur in $8$-horse race (excluding ties)?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item $8$~choices for first place
\item $7$~choices for second place
\item $6$~choices for third place
\item So $8\cdot 7\cdot 6=336$ possible finishes
\item Note that $8\cdot 7\cdot 6=\npr{8}{3}$
\item Indeed, problem asks for number of permutations
of $8$~objects taken $3$ at a time
\item \dots dressed up with intriguing story about horse racing
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{question}
How many different foursomes can be formed
from among $7$~golfers?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item Members of foursome meant to sign names on scorecard
\item More concrete to count number of ways to fill out scorecard
\item $7$~choices for first name
\item $6$~choices for second, $5$ for third, $4$ for fourth
\item Thus $\npr{7}{4}=7\cdot 6\cdot 5\cdot 4=840$ ways for
players to fill out scorecard
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item However, if same foursome signed names in different order on scorecard,
would be counted as \alert{different foursome}
\item Thus $840$ includes considerable duplication
\item In how many ways could particular foursome fill out scorecard?
\item $4$~choices for first name, $3$ for second, etc
\item So $4!=\npr{4}{4}=24$ ways for particular foursome to fill out scorecard
\item Thus $840$ counts each possible foursome $24$~times 
\item So $\frac{840}{24}=35$ possible foursomes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{question}
How many different ways to arrange a particular $13$-card
bridge hand?
\end{question}
\begin{itemize}
\item $13!=\npr{13}{13}=6,227,020,800$
\begin{question}
How many different $13$-card bridge hands are there?
\end{question}
\item Arranged from left to right in player's hand,
\item $52$~choices for first card, $51$ for second, etc
\item So $52\cdot 51\cdots 40=\npr{52}{13}$
\item However, any particular hand counted $13!$~times (see example above)
\item Thus $\frac{\npr{52}{13}}{13!}
=635,013,559,600$ possible hands
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item All examples above involve selection \alert{without replacement}
\item So after each selection, number of choices decreases by one
\item Accounts for appearance of consecutive numbers decreasing
by one, as in $8\cdot 7\cdot 6$
\item If replacement had been possible, numbers would remain same
instead of decrease
\item For example, spinning American roulette wheel three times
has $38\cdot 38\cdot 38$ possible outcomes
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item In horse and bridge hand arrangement examples, order of choices
significant
\item In golf and bridge hand examples, order of choices irrelevant
\item Determining whether order matters requires careful reading of question
and realistic thought about problem
\item Note that word \alert{arrangement} in bridge hand arrangement
question a cue
\item But no such word present in horse question
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
