\begin{questions}
\question What is the probability
The following table lists
the languages other than English spoken by residents
of Iowa between 2008 and 2012, organized by the age
of the resident.\footnote{Source: {\tt www.census.gov}}
\[\begin{array}{r|rrr|r}
\text{Language}&\text{$5$--$17$}
&\text{$18$--$64$}&\ge 65&\text{Total}\\\hline
\text{Spanish or Spanish Creole}&32,196&75,674&4,114&111,984\\
\text{Other Indo-European}&8,978&29,811&6,530&45,319\\
\text{Asian or Pacific Island}&5,624&27,022&2,255&34,901\\
\text{Other}&2,386&7,874&423&10,683\\\hline
\text{Total}&49,184&140,381&13,322&202,887
\end{array}\]
\begin{parts}
\part How many residents of age $65$ and older
spoke a language other than English?
\part What is the probability that a randomly selected
resident spoke an Asian or Pacific Island language
given that that individual was between $18$ and $64$ years old?
\part What is the probability that a randomly selected
resident that spoke a language other than English
was between $5$ and $17$ years old?
\end{parts}

\question Two cards are drawn at random from a deck of playing cards
without replacement.
\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability that both cards are kings?
\part What is the probability that the second card is a King
given that the first card is an Queen?
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part $\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}
\approx 0.005$
\part $\frac{4}{51}\approx 0.078$
\end{parts}
\end{solution}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\question
New Jersey license plates contain a letter,
followed by two digits, followed by three letters,
as illustrated in the image at the right.
How many license plates in New Jersey are possible?\\
\columnbreak
\includegraphics[scale=.3]{NewJersy}
\end{multicols}
\begin{solution}
$26\cdot 10\cdot 10\cdot 26\cdot 26\cdot 26=26^4\cdot 10^2
=45,697,600$
\end{solution}

\question How many anagrams of the word
{\textsf{Machiavellianism}} are there?
\begin{solution}
The number of times each distinct letter appears is
shown in the following table.
\[\begin{array}{r|cccccccccc}
\text{letter}&a&c&e&h&i&l&m&n&s&v\\\hline
\text{frequency}&3&1&1&1&3&2&2&1&1&1
\end{array}\]
Thus the number of anagrams is
\[\frac{16!}{3!3!2!2!}=145,297,152,000.\]
\end{solution}

\question In a recent survey of 884 Americans between the ages
of $18$ and $50$, $120$ reported that they have tattoos,
$72$ have body piercings, and $41$ have both.
\footnote{2004, American Journal of Dermatology}
\begin{parts}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a tattoo?
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a piercing?
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a both a tattoo and a piercing?
\part\label{Independent} According to this data do
the decision to get a piercing and the decision
to get a tattoo appear to be independent?
\part Does your response to \ref{Independent} make
sense in this context?
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a tattoo given that that individual
has a piercing?
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected American has a piercing given that that individual
does {\bf not} have a piercing?
\end{parts}


\question Suppose $E=\left\{a,c,d,e,f\right\}$,
$F=\left\{b,c,g,h,i\right\}$, and $G=\left\{a,b,e,h,i\right\}$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $\left(E\cup G\right)\cap\left(F\cup G\right)$
\part Calculate $\left(E\cap F\right)\cup G$
\end{parts}
