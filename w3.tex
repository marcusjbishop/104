\begin{enumerate}
\item List all the subsets of $\left\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\right\}$
of size two.
\item\label{pizza}
List all the subsets of $\left\{a,b,c,d,e\right\}$ of size three.
\item Use your response to (\ref{pizza}) to solve the following problem.
Marcus's Pizza offers five different pizza toppings,
namely, artichoke hearts, broccoli, capers, daikon, and eggplant.
What is the probability that a randomly ordered three-topping pizza
will include both artichoke hearts and broccoli?
\item Use your response to (\ref{pizza}) again to solve the following problem.
What is the probability that a randomly ordered three-topping pizza from Marcus's
will {\em not} include daikon or eggplant?
