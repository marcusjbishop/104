\question[12] Ames High School has $1422$ students.
$101$ students are in band but not chorus while
$175$ students are in chorus but not band.
If $1097$ students are in neither band nor chorus,
then how many students are in both band and chorus?

\question[15] Your itinerary for Saturday should
include a trip to Target, Staples, Hy-Vee, and the bank.
However, since Target is across the street from Staples,
you should visit those two stores consecutively. In other
words, you should visit Target right after Staples, or else
Staples right after Target. In how many ways
can you plan your itinerary?

\question[15] Suppose $E$ and $F$ are events
and $P\left(E\right)=0.55$ and $P\left(F\right)=0.25$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming that $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive.
\vspace{.5in}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ and $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\vspace{.5in}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part $0.55+0.25=0.8$
\part $0.55\cdot 0.25=0.1375$
\part $0.55+0.25-0.1375=0.6625$
\end{parts}

\question[10] If two cards are randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards without replacement,
then what is the probability that neither card
will be a picture card? A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King.
\begin{solution}
$\frac{40}{52}\cdot\frac{39}{51}=\frac{10}{17}\approx 0.05882$

\question[12] A Math~104 quiz has eight multiple-choice
questions, each with four answer choices. If you guess on all
eight questions, then what is the probability that you will answer at
least one question correctly?
\begin{solution}
$1-\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^8\approx 0.8999$
\end{solution}

\question[16] Two dice are rolled and the
numbers showing on the top faces are observed.
Determine the odds against each of the following events.
\begin{parts}
\part Both numbers are the same
\vspace{.5in}
\part The sum of the two numbers is $4$
\vspace{.5in}
\part The sum of the two numbers is odd 
\vspace{.5in}
\part At least one of the numbers is $2$
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
\begin{parts}
\part Can occur in $6$ ways, so $30:6$ or $5:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $3$ ways, so $33:3$ or $11:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $18$ ways, so $18:18$ or $1:1$ the odds against
\part Can occur in $11$ ways, so $25:11$ the odds against

\question[10]
\begin{multicols}{2}
If you drop a thumbtack on the floor, it either lands point down
or point up, as shown in the image at the right.
You drop a handful of thumbtacks on the floor, observing that
$136$~tacks land point down while $34$ land point up.
Based on these results, if you drop two thumbtacks on the floor, what
is the probability that both tacks will land point up?
\columnbreak\\
\includegraphics[scale=.6]{Thumbtacks}
\end{multicols}
\begin{solution}
$\frac{34}{34+136}=\frac{1}{5}$ the empirical probability
of point up, so $\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)^2=\frac{1}{25}$
the probability of both points up
\end{solution}

\question[10] A game is played as follows.
Two coins are flipped. If both coins come up
heads, then you win $\$1$. If both coins come
up tails, then you win $\$2$. 
Otherwise you lose $\$4$. What are your expected proceeds
of this game?
\begin{solution}
$1\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)+2\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)
-4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)=-\frac{5}{4}=\$-1.25$
\end{solution}
