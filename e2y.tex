\question[12]
Suppose that $E$, $F$, and $G$ are subsets
of the universal set
\[U=\left\{a,e,i,k,l,n,r,s,x,z\right\}.\]
The elements of
$E,F,G$ are as shown in the Venn diagram
at the right.
List all the elements of the following sets.
\begin{parts}
\part $\left(E\cap F\right)\cup G$
\begin{solution}[.5in]
$\left\{i,s,r,e,a,l\right\}$
\end{solution}
\part $\left(F\cup G\right)'$

$\left\{n,z\right\}$

\question[24] Two dice are rolled and the
numbers showing on the top faces are observed.
Determine the probability of each of the following events.
\begin{parts}
\part Both numbers are the same
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Can occur in $6$ ways,
so $\frac{6}{36}=\frac{1}{6}$ the probability
\end{solution}
\part The sum of the two numbers is $9$
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Can occur in $4$ ways,
so $\frac{4}{36}=\frac{1}{9}$ the probability
\end{solution}
\part The sum of the two numbers is odd 
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Can occur in $18$ ways,
so $\frac{18}{36}=\frac{1}{2}$ the probability
\end{solution}
\part At least one of the numbers is $6$
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Can occur in $11$ ways, so $\frac{11}{36}$ the probability
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[15]
A {\em G8~Summit} is a roulette bet,
available only in the private casino located
in your instructor's basement, on any of the spaces labeled by
$0,00,1,2,3,4,5,6$. The payout for a $\$1$~G8~Summit
is $\$3$.
Note that this is an {\bf exception} to the
payout rule $\textstyle\frac{36}{n}-1$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the probability of winning a G8~Summit.
\begin{solution}[.5in] $\frac{8}{38}=\frac{4}{19}
\approx 0.2105$
\end{solution}
\part Calculate the {\bf odds against}
winning a G8~Summit.
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Since $38-8=30$~spaces are losing, the odds against winning
are $30:8$ or $15:4$.
\end{solution}
\part Calculate the expectation on a $\$1$~G8~Summit.
Round your answer to the nearest cent.
\begin{solution}[1in]
$3\left(\frac{4}{19}\right)-
1\left(\frac{15}{19}\right)=-\frac{3}{19}
\approx -\$0.16$
\end{solution}
\part How could the $\$3$~payout
be changed so that the G8~Summit would be fair?
\begin{solution}[.5in]
Change the payout to $\frac{15}{4}\approx\$3.75$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[16] Your itinerary for Saturday should
include a trip to Target, Staples, Hy-Vee, and the bank.
However, since Target is across the street from Staples,
you should visit those two stores consecutively. In other
words, you should visit Target immediately after Staples, or else
Staples immediately after Target. In how many ways
can you plan your itinerary?

\question[15] Suppose that $E$ and $F$ are events
and $P\left(E\right)=0.65$ and $P\left(F\right)=0.3$.
Do not round your answers to the following questions.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming that $E$ and $F$ are mutually exclusive.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$0.65+0.3=0.95$
\end{solution}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ and $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$0.65\cdot 0.3=0.195$
\end{solution}
\part Calculate $P\left(\text{$E$ or $F$}\right)$
assuming $E$ and $F$ are independent.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$0.65+0.3-0.195=0.755$
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[18] Ames High School has $1422$ students.
$101$ students are in band but not chorus while
$181$ students are in chorus but not band.

then how many students are in both band and chorus?
