\section{Time, place}\label{Time} Class meets at 12:10--13:00
in Coover~2245 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
The final exam is at 14:15--16:15 on Wednesday 17~December.

\section{Requirements, prerequisites, materials}
To take this course you should have taken two
years of high school algebra and one year of high school geometry.
In addition, you should
have received a satisfactory score on your mathematics placement exam.
For the course you will need a copy of the textbook
and a scientific calculator.
I use a \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-83}{TI-83} or a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84}{TI-84}, although
the graphing and algebraic facilities of these devices are
not needed for Math~104.

\section{Instructor information} You may visit me during my office 
hours at 14:00--15:00 on Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays
in Carver~418. If my office hours are inconvenient for you
please contact me at 
\href{mailto:mbishop@iastate.edu}{\tt mbishop@iastate.edu} or at 
515-294-0027 to arrange an alternate time.
You can also visit the Math Help Room (see \autoref{MathCenter}).

\section{Course goals, content}
In this course we will learn the rudiments of combinatorics,
including combinations, permutations, and the binomial theorem,
as well as various counting techniques.
Our primary motivation for learning combinatorics is that it
plays an important role in the theory of probability, the main
topic of the course. We will also explore some
applications of probability in gambling. Indeed, probability
arose in the seventeenth century in response to the need
to understand the likelihood of winning at games of chance.
Students should not presume that the course is intended to
promote gambling. On the contrary, we expect that most
students will abstain from gambling after learning the mathematics
behind a number of games.

\section{Course objectives}
\subsection{Basic Rules of Discrete Probability}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Understand the concept of {\em sample space} and be able to construct sample spaces for simple experiments
\item Understand the definition of {\em probability} in the case where all outcomes are equally likely
\item Understand and be able to apply the basic rules for probability,
namely the union, intersection and complement of an event
\item Understand the concept of {\em conditional probability}
and be able to compute the conditional probability of simple events
\item Understand the significance of tree diagrams
when computing conditional probability
\item Understand the concept of {\em independent events}
\item To have some exposure to real-life cases, such as court decisions,
where the concept of independent events was misapplied
\item To understand the concept of {\em expected value}
and be able to compute the expected value in cases where the
outcomes of an experiment and their probabilities are known
\item To have some idea of how {\em expected value}
is applied in certain real-life situations,
including insurance policies and other forms of risk-taking
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Basic Principles of Combinatorics}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To understand the meaning of combinations and permutations,
and the difference between them
\item To know the definition of the binomial coefficients
and to be able to compute simple examples of them
\item To use the concept of combinations and permutations
to solve simple counting problems
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Applications to Games and Gambling}
\begin{enumerate}
\item To understand the basic rules and bets for poker
(video, Texas Hold Em, and other variants)
and to be able to compute the probabilities of the various hands
\item To understand the basic rules of the game of Blackjack,
to be able to compute simple probabilities associated with the game,
and to understand the mathematics behind {\em card counting}
\item To understand the basic rules of roulette,
to be able to analyze the various bets using the concept of expected value,
to understand why there is no such thing as a perfect {\em system}
for winning this and other gambling games,
to understand why European poker (with no 00)
is a better bet for the gambler than American poker
\item To understand the rules of some of the various lottery games,
including Powerball,
to be able to compute the probability of winning the jackpot,
and to appreciate why lottery tickets are such poor bets
\item To understand the rules of Backgammon and to be able to use
probability to determine the best moves in certain situations
\item To apply conditional probability to analyze
and understand the game of craps
\item To use probability to analyze other games,
including Farkle, Keno or Chuck-a-Luck
\end{enumerate}

\section{Calculation of grades}\label{Assessment}
Grades will be assigned by a spreadsheet formula, which will count
the three exams for 15\% each,
the written assignments for 20\% (see \autoref{Written}),
the quizzes for 15\%, and the final exam for 20\%.
You will receive an A, B, C, D, F if your total lies in the range
90--100\%, 80--89\%, 70--79\%, 60--69\%, 0--60\% respectively.
All the scores mentioned above will be available to you in
\href{https://bb.its.iastate.edu}{Blackboard}. Using your scores
and the formula above, you should be able to calculate your own final grade,
and even estimate your final grade midway through the semester.
It is therefore unnecessary for you to ever ask the instructor
what your grade in the course is, which we kindly ask you to refrain from
doing.

We emphasize that the grades will be calculated by a computer program in the manner described
above, not ``curved''. However, in the unlikely event that an exam or quiz question is determined
to be unfair or overly difficult, it will be dropped from the total score of
every student.

\section{Written assignments}\label{Written}
There is a written assignment due {\em every 
class period}, including class periods
in which quizzes or exams occur.
The assignments will be posted on \href{https://bb.its.iastate.edu}{Blackboard}.
They will be collected at the beginning
of class on randomly selected days, approximately
once per week. Collected assignments
will be graded and returned shortly thereafter.
The course is designed in such a way that if you complete each assignment and 
correct the mistakes your make on them,
then you will be very well prepared for all the quizzes and exams.
While we encourage you to {\em discuss} homework problems with other
students, we advise you to work alone most of the time,
as working alone most closely reflects the context of an exam.
In order to accommodate unforeseen events that would cause you
to pass up the opportunity submit assignments on time,
we will exclude from your final grade
the three written assignments with the lowest scores among
all your written assignments.

\section{Expectations, suggestions} Naturally we expect you to attend 
class meetings, complete and submit assignments on 
time, prepare for quizzes and exams, and participate in classroom 
activities. We also strongly encourage you to read the textbook
in addition to attending lectures.
In addition to being generally prudent to 
supplement your learning materials, reading the text has a number of 
advantages over attending lectures alone. Namely, the text is beautifully 
typeset and edited by professionals, very clearly written with readers 
of exactly your level in mind, and virtually free of mistakes.
