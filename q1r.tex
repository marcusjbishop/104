\begin{questions}

\question Consider the experiment consisting
of rolling two dice and adding the numbers
appearing on the top faces of the dice.
The experiment is repeated $200$ times and the
results shown in the table below. Namely, 
for each possible outcome, the table shows the number
of times the outcome occurred directly below the outcome.
\[\begin{array}{r|ccccccccccc}
\text{outcome}&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10&11&12\\\hline
\text{frequency}&6&16&22&20&27&27&25&25&9&19&4
\end{array}\]
Based on these results, what is the {\em empirical} probability
that the sum will be seven if the experiment is performed again?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{7}{100}$
\choice $\frac{7}{200}$
\correctchoice $\frac{27}{200}$
\choice $\frac{1}{6}$
\choice $\frac{27}{100}$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question If an event $E$ has probability $\frac{1}{3}$
of occurring, then what are the {\bf odds against} $E$?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $1:1$
\choice $1:2$ % odds in favor
\choice $1:3$ % write as fraction
\correctchoice $2:1$
\choice $3:1$ % wrote reciprocal as fraction
\end{oneparchoices}

\question Math~104 currently has 122~women and 93~men enrolled.
If a student is selected at random, what is the probability
that the student will be male?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice $\frac{93}{215}$
\choice $\frac{122}{215}$

\end{oneparchoices}

\question If an event has probability $0.35$
what is the probability that the event will {\bf not} occur?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $0.0$
\choice $0.35$
\correctchoice $0.65$
\choice $0.7$
\choice $1.0$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question If a card is selected at random from a deck of
playing cards, what is the probability that
the card will have suit $\clubsuit$?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{1}{52}$
\choice $\frac{1}{13}$
\correctchoice $\frac{1}{4}$
\choice $\frac{3}{4}$
\choice $\frac{12}{13}$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question If an event $E$ has probability $0.55$
calculate $P\left(E\right)+P\left(\text{not $E$}\right)$.\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $0.0$
\choice $0.45$
\choice $0.5$
\choice $0.55$
\correctchoice $1.0$
\end{oneparchoices}

\question Probability computed by studying
the possible outcomes of an experiment is called \dots\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice computational.
\choice conditional.
\choice empirical.
\choice relative.
\correctchoice theoretical.
\end{oneparchoices}

\question If $2:3$ are the odds in favor
of an event, then what is the probability of the event?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $\frac{2}{3}$ % wrote as fraction
\correctchoice $\frac{2}{5}$
\choice $\frac{3}{5}$ % probability of complement
\choice $\frac{3}{2}$ % wrote complement as fraction
\choice $\frac{5}{3}$ % probability of complement as fraction
\end{oneparchoices}

\question Probability calculated by relative frequency is called \dots\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice conditional.
\correctchoice empirical.
\choice random.
\choice relative.
\choice theoretical.
\end{oneparchoices}

\question If two parents have genotypes $cc$ and $cC$
with respect to the gene for Cystic Fibrosis, what
is the probability that one of their children will have
Cystic Fibrosis?\\
\begin{oneparchoices}
\choice $0$
\choice $\frac{1}{4}$
\choice $\frac{1}{3}$
