\begin{enumerate}

\item A poker hand is called a {\em flush} if all five cards
have the same suit.
\begin{enumerate}
\item\label{hf} Calculate the number of possible {\em heart flush}es,
that is, the number of hands where all five cards have suit $\heartsuit$.\\
{\bf Answer:} $\ncr{13}{5}=1287$
\item Use your response to (\ref{hf}) to count the number of
possible flushes.\\
{\bf Answer:} $1287\cdot 4=5148$
\item What is the probability of being dealt a flush?\\
{\bf Answer:} $\frac{5148}{2598960}
=\frac{33}{16660}\approx 0.0020$
\end{enumerate}
\item A hand is called a {\em straight} if the ranks of the five
cards appear consecutively in the list
\[A,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A.\]
Note that $A$ appears at the beginning and at the end of the list, but
that no other ``wrapping around'' is allowed.
For example, $7\heartsuit,8\spadesuit,9\clubsuit,10\clubsuit,J\heartsuit$
is a straight.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the number of possible straights.\\
{\bf Answer:} $10\cdot 4^5=10240$
\item Calculate the probability of being dealt a straight.\\
{\bf Answer:}
$\frac{10240}{2598960}=\frac{128}{32487}\approx 0.0040$
\end{enumerate}

\item A hand is called a {\em straight flush} if it is both
a straight and a flush. Calculate the probability of being dealt
a straight flush.\\
{\bf Answer:}
$\frac{40}{2598960}=\frac{1}{64974}\approx 0.00002$

\item A flush which is not also a straight flush is called a {\em mere flush}
(in this course only).
Calculate the probability of being dealt a mere flush.\\
{\bf Answer:}
$\frac{5148-40}{2598960}
=\frac{5108}{2598960}
=\frac{1277}{649740}\approx 0.0020$

\item A straight flush whose cards have ranks $A,K,Q,J,10$ is called
a {\em royal flush}. 
Calculate the probability of being dealt a royal flush.\\
{\bf Answer:}
$\frac{4}{2598960}=\frac{1}{649740}\approx 0.000002$
\end{enumerate}
