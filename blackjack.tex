\begin{frame}{Blackjack}
\begin{itemize}
\item We consider casino version
\item Also exists friendly version
\item In casino version player play against dealer, not against one another
\item Each player makes bet
\item Dealer deals each player two face-up cards
\item She also deals herself one face-up, one face-down
\item $J,K,Q$ worth $10$~points
\item $A$ worth either $1$ or $11$~points, whichever convenient
\item Remaining cards worth value shown on card
\item Players can request further cards, as many as desired
\item Accomplished by saying \alert{hit me}
\item Sum of player's cards should be as close to $21$ as possible
without exceeding $21$
\item If sum exceeds $21$ player loses bet (a \alert{bust})
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item When remaining players (if any) satisfied with their sums,
dealer hits herself as needed
\item Dealer \alert{must} hit herself if her sum $\le 16$
\item However, she must stop hitting herself when her sum $\ge 17$
\item If her sum $>21$ (she \alert{busts}), player wins amount bet
\item Suppose her sum $\le 21$
\item If her sum closer to $21$ than player's sum,
player loses bet
\item If player's sum closer to $21$ than dealer's sum,
player wins amount bet
\item \dots unless player's sum $21$ (a \alert{blackjack})
\item Then player wins $\frac{3}{2}$ amount bet
\item If dealer's sum equals player's sum, no money exchanged
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why blackjack favors casino}
\begin{itemize}
\item Game sounds perfectly symmetric: dealer as likely
as player to arrive at sum closest to $21$
\item Why does game favor casino?
\item If player busts, player loses automatically
\item Dealer doesn't even need to hit herself if player busts
\item If she does hit and busts, player still loses
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability of blackjack}
\begin{itemize}
\item Two cards whose sum $21$ called a \alert{blackjack}
\item If player receives blackjack in first two cards,
he wins unless dealer also has blackjack
\item Calculate probability of receiving blackjack on first two cards
\item Can only happen if one card is $A$ and other
has value $10$
\item So other card must be $10$, $J$, $Q$, or $K$
\item Four choices for $A$
\item $16$~choices for other card
\item So $4\cdot 16=64$ blackjacks possible
\item $\ncr{52}{2}=1326$ two-card hands possible 
\item So $\frac{64}{1326}\approx 0.0483$ the probability of blackjack
\item We'll round answer to $\frac{1}{20}$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item All our blackjack calculations only approximate
\item One issue: dealer often uses several decks of cards, rather than one
\item So $\frac{1}{52}$ the
approximate probability of receiving any particular card
\item \dots even though card might already appear on table
\item $\frac{1}{13}$ the probability of receiving card
of any particular rank
\item Casino's use of several decks probably intended to foil
intentions of \alert{card counters} (discussed later)
\item Blackjack can be played virtually at
\href{http://wizardofodds.com/play/blackjack}{\color{blue}\tt wizardofodds}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability of winning with blackjack}
\begin{itemize}
\item If player receives blackjack
%(with probability $\approx\frac{1}{20}$
what is probability he wins?
\item Player loses only if dealer also has blackjack
\item Dealer has blackjack with probability $\textstyle\frac{1}{20}$
\item So player wins with probability $\textstyle\frac{19}{20}$
\item So $\frac{1}{20}\cdot\frac{19}{20}
\approx\frac{1}{20}$ the probability of getting blackjack and winning
\end{itemize}
\begin{remark}
\begin{itemize}
\item Player receiving blackjack and dealer not receiving blackjack
not independent
\item So strictly speaking 
$\frac{1}{20}\cdot\frac{19}{20}$ incorrect
\item However, suffices for approximate calculation
\end{itemize}
\end{remark}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability of busting if hit}
\begin{itemize}
\item Most important question: should player take another card?
\item Want to calculate probability that player busts
if hit
\item Depends on cards player has
\item Will assume several decks being used
\end{itemize}
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose player has $J\hs,5\cs$
\item Ranks that \alert{won't} bust player:
$A,2,3,4,5,6$
\item $\frac{6}{13}$ the probability player won't bust if hit
\item So $\frac{7}{13}$ the probability player busts if hit
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Probability distribution of blackjack}
\begin{itemize}
\item Want to calculate probability player winds up with particular sum
\item To simplify problem, suppose player follows dealer's rule
\item Namely, he hits if his sum $\le 16$, stands if $\ge 17$
\item So possible outcomes $17,18,19,20,21$ or blackjack or bust
\item Have already calculated probability of blackjack
\item Remaining outcomes too difficult to calculate,
since each outcome can happen in many ways
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item List shows all ways to get sum of $17$
\item List has $267$ entries
\item \alert{T} denotes $10$, $J$, $Q$, or $K$
\item So each entry containing \alert{T}
represents $4$ outcomes
\end{itemize}
\input{17}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Nevertheless, can use computer to calculate
distribution:\footnote{Source:

P\left(r\right)&0.15&0.15&0.14&0.18&0.05&0.05&0.28
\end{array}\]
\begin{example}
\begin{itemize}
\item Suppose you wind up with $17$
\item Calculate probability that you win
\item You lose if dealer has $18,19,20,21$ or blackjack, with
probability $0.15+0.14+0.18+0.05+0.05=0.57$
\item You tie (or \alert{push})
if dealer has $17$, with probability $0.15$
\item You win if she busts, with probability $0.28$
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{One strategy}
\begin{itemize}
\item One possible strategy from
\href{http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470624450.html}
{\color{blue}Olofsson}:
\begin{itemize}
\item If sum $\le 11$ hit (can't possibly exceed $21$ by hitting)
\item If dealer has $7$ or greater face-up, continue hitting until
sum $\ge 17$
\item If dealer has $2,3,4,5$ or $6$ face-up, continue hitting
until sum $\ge 12$
\item \dots unless sum exactly $12$ and dealer has $2$ or $3$
face-up; then hit
\end{itemize}
\item Strategy comes with no guarantee
\item More complicated strategies exist, often resulting
from computer simulation involving millions of games
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Card counting}
\begin{itemize}
\item Listen to
\href{http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/466/blackjack}
{\color{blue}This American Life} episode on card counting
\item Observe that deck rich in high cards favors player because
\begin{itemize}
\item Dealer must hit until her sum $\ge 17$
\item \dots but higher cards more likely to bust her
\item Also, blackjacks more likely if deck has many higher cards
\item However, she pays you $\frac{3}{2}$ amount bet
if you receive blackjack
\item \dots but she only receives your bet if she receives blackjack
\end{itemize}
\item Conversely deck rich in low cards favors dealer
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item But how to know if deck rich in high cards?
\item By keeping track!
\item Hi-lo method:
\begin{itemize}
\item When dealer shuffles, player keeps running tally,
beginning with zero
\item Player adds one every time dealer deals $2,3,4,5,6$
\item Player subtracts one every time dealer deals $J,K,Q,A$
\item When tally reaches $+10$, say, player should bet more
\item When tally negative, player should bet less
\end{itemize}
\item Players began card counting in 1960's with publication
of Edward O. Thorp's 1962 book {\em Beat the Dealer}
\item Casinos responded to card counters by using several decks,
shuffling more often, harassing suspected counters, etc.
\end{itemize}
