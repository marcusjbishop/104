\begin{frame}{Blackjack}
\begin{itemize}
\item We consider casino version
\item Also exists friendly version
\item In casino version player play against dealer, not against one another
\item Each player makes bet
\item Dealer deals each player two face-up cards
\item She also deals herself one face-up, one face-down
\item $J,K,Q$ worth $10$~points
\item $A$ worth either $1$ or $11$~points, whichever convenient
\item Remaining cards worth value shown on card
\item Players can request further cards, as many as desired
\item Accomplished by saying \alert{hit me}
\item Sum of player's cards should be as close to $21$ as possible,
but not $>21$
\item If sum $>21$ player loses bet (a \alert{bust})
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
\item When remaining players (if any) happy with their sums,
dealer hits herself as needed
\item Dealer \alert{must} hit herself if her sum $\le 16$
\item However, she must stop hitting herself when her sum $\ge 17$
\item If her sum $>21$ (she \alert{busts}), player wins amount bet
\item Suppose her sum $\le 21$
\item If her sum closer to $21$ than player's sum,
player loses bet
\item If player's sum closer to $21$ than dealer's sum,
player wins amount bet
\item \dots unless player's sum $21$ (a \alert{blackjack}
\item Then player wins $\frac{3}{2}$ amount bet
\item If dealer's sum equals player's sum, no money exchanged
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why blackjack favors casino}
\begin{itemize}
\item Game sounds perfectly symmetric: dealer as likely
as player to arrive at sum closest to $21$
\item Why does game favor casino?
\item If player busts, player loses automatically
\item Dealer doesn't need to hit herself if all players bust
\item If she does hit and busts, players who bust earlier still lose
\end{itemize}
