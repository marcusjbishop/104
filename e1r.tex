\question[15] A die is rolled and the number
showing on the top face observed. Determine the probability
of each of the following events.
\begin{parts}
\part The number is $5$
\begin{solution}[1.25in]$\frac{1}{6}$\end{solution}
\part The number is less than $5$
\begin{solution}[1.25in]$\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$\end{solution}
\part The number is odd
\begin{solution}[1.25in]$\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[10] The results of the first quiz in Math~104 are
shown in the table below. For each possible score, the number
of students receiving that score is shown directly below
the score.
\[\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}
\text{Score}&2&3&4&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\hline
\text{Frequency}&4&5&9&21&25&20&21&19&16\\
\end{array}\]
Calculate the empirical probability that a randomly
selected Math~104 student scored seven or higher
on the first quiz.
\begin{solution}[2in]
\[\frac{20+21+19+16}{4+5+9+21+25+20+21+19+16}
=\frac{76}{140}=\frac{19}{35}\approx 0.5429\]
\end{solution}

\question[15] Suppose that a woman has genotype $\mathbold{cC}$
and her husband has genotype $\mathbold{cc}$ for a
genetically inherited disorder.
If they decide to become parents, calculate the
probability that their child will
have the following genotypes.
\begin{parts}
\part $\mathbold{cc}$
\begin{solution}[1.25in]
The Punnett square is
$\begin{array}{c|cc}
&\mathbold{c}&\mathbold{C}\\\hline
\mathbold{c}&\mathbold{cc}&\mathbold{cC}\\
\mathbold{c}&\mathbold{cc}&\mathbold{cC}\end{array}$
so $\mathbold{cc}$ occurs with probability~$\frac{1}{2}$.
\end{solution}
\part either $\mathbold{Cc}$ or $\mathbold{cC}$
\begin{solution}[1.25in]$\frac{1}{2}$\end{solution}
\part $\mathbold{CC}$
\begin{solution}[1.25in]$0$\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[25]
Marcus and Alex are playing the following game repeatedly.
Marcus selects a card at random from a deck of cards.
If the card is a picture card, then Alex pays Marcus $\$10$.
Otherwise Marcus pays Alex $\$5$.
A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King.
Then the card is reinserted into the deck and the
game repeated.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the probability of drawing a picture card.
\begin{solution}[.75in]$\frac{3}{13}$\end{solution}
\part Calculate the {\bf odds against} drawing a picture card.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$\frac{10/13}{3/13}=\frac{10}{3}$ so the odds
against drawing a picture card are $10:3$.
\end{solution}
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for Marcus.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$10\left(\frac{3}{13}\right)-5\left(\frac{10}{13}\right)
=-\frac{20}{13}\approx -1.54$
\end{solution}
\part How can the payments be changed so that the game
will be fair to both players?
\begin{solution}[1in] Change Marcus's payment to $\$3$. Then
Marcus's expectation is
$10\left(\frac{3}{13}\right)-3\left(\frac{10}{13}\right)=0$.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[20] To raise money the swim team sells
600~raffle tickets
for $\$2$ each. They will randomly select
a ticket holder to receive a prize of $\$200$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for someone
who buys a ticket.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$198\left(\frac{1}{600}\right)-2\left(\frac{599}{600}\right)
=-\frac{1000}{600}=-\frac{5}{3}\approx -1.67$
\end{solution}
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the swim team.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$600\cdot 2-200=1000$
\end{solution}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$2-\frac{5}{3}=\frac{1}{3}\approx 0.34$.
\end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question[15]
The chart above shows the distribution
of blood types of residents of Australia.
\begin{parts}
\part If an Australian is selected at random,
what is the probability that he or she
does {\bf not} have blood type {A+}?
\begin{solution}[.75in]$1-0.31=0.69$\end{solution}
\part What are the {\bf odds against} a randomly
selected Australian having blood type {O+}?
\begin{solution}[.75in]
$\frac{0.6}{0.4}=\frac{3}{2}$ so the odds against
{O+} are $3:2$.
\end{solution}
\part What is the probability that a randomly
selected Australian has blood type either
{O+} or {O-}?
\begin{solution}[.75in]$0.4+0.09=0.49$\end{solution}
