\question[12] In the French version of roulette, a ball stops
on a slot labeled $0$--$36$. Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as in the American version.
A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses the $\$1$. Calculated the expected
proceeds on this bet.
