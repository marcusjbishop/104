\begin{questions}

\question[12] In the French version of roulette, a ball stops
on a slot labeled $0$--$36$. Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as in the American wheel discussed in class.
\begin{parts}
\part A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses the $\$1$. Calculated the expected
proceeds on this bet.
\part In general players can bet that the ball stops on any
of $n$ chosen numbers. If the ball stops on one of those
slots the casino pays the player $\frac{36}{n}-1$ times
the player's bet. Otherwise the player loses the bet. If a player
bets $\$1$ that the ball will land on an odd number, calculate
the expected proceeds of the bet.
\end{parts}

\question[12] An insurance company sells $\$100,000$
life insurance policies for $\$P$. This means that the customer
pays the company $\$P$. Then
if the customer dies within one year, the company
pays the customer's estate $\$100,000$ but keeps the $\$P$.
If the customer survives, the company pays the customer nothing, and again
keeps the $\$P$. What is the {\em minimum} amount $P$ the
company should charge the customer in order
for the company to profit? In other words, what is the minimum
$P$ for which the expected proceeds of the company will be positive?
