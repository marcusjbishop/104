\begin{questions}

\question[12] In the French version of roulette, a ball stops
on a slot labeled $0$--$36$. Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as on the American wheel discussed in class.
\begin{parts}
\part A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the player keeps
the $\$1$ and the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses the $\$1$. Calculated the expected
proceeds for the player.
\part In general players can bet that the ball stops on any
number $n$ of chosen slots. If the ball stops on one of those
slots the player keeps the bet
and the casino pays the player $\frac{36}{n}-1$ times
the player's bet. Otherwise the player loses the bet. If a player
bets $\$1$ that the ball will land on an odd number, calculate
the expected proceeds for the player.
\end{parts}

\question[12] An insurance company sells a $\$100,000$
life insurance policy for $\$P$. 
In other words, a customer pays the company $\$P$;
if the customer dies within one year, the company
pays the customer's estate $\$100,000$ but keeps the $\$P$;
if the customer survives, the company pays the customer nothing, and again
keeps the $\$P$. What is the {\em minimum} amount $P$ the
company should charge for this policy in order
for the company to profit in the long run?

\question[8] If the odds against a golfer winning a match
are $7:2$ what is the probability that she will win?

\question[10] If a card is randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards, what is the probability that the card
will either be a picture card or have suit $\varheart$?
A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King.

\question[12]
Suppose that a woman has genotype $cC$
and her husband has genotype $cc$ for a
genetically inherited trait.
If they decide to become parents, calculate the
the probability that their child will
have the following genotypes.
\begin{parts}
\part $cc$
\part either $Cc$ or $cC$
\part $CC$
\end{parts}

\question[8] $37\%$ of North Americans have blood type $O+$.
If a North American is selected at random, what are the odds
against this individual having blood type $O+$?

\question[10] To raise money the volleyball team sells 200~raffle tickets
for $\$5$ each. They will randomly select a ticket holder to receive
a prize of $\$150$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the volleyball team.
\end{parts}

\question[10] The results of the first quiz in Math~104 are
shown in the table below. For each possible score, the number
of students receiving that score is shown directly below
the score.
\[\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
\text{Score}&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\hline
\text{Frequency}&4&7&21&54&75&53
\end{array}\]
Calculate the empirical probability that a randomly
selected Math~104 student will score $7$ or higher
on the first quiz.
