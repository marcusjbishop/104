\begin{questions}

\question[12] In the French version of roulette, a ball stops
on a slot labeled $0$--$36$. Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as in the American wheel discussed in class.
\begin{parts}
\part A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses the $\$1$. Calculated the expected
proceeds on this bet.
\part In general players can bet that the ball stops on any
of $n$ chosen numbers. If the ball stops on one of those
slots the casino pays the player $\frac{36}{n}-1$ times
the player's bet. Otherwise the player loses the bet. If a player
bets $\$1$ that the ball will land on an odd number, calculate
the expected proceeds of the bet.
\end{parts}

\question[12] An insurance company sells $\$100,000$
life insurance policies for $\$P$. This means that the customer
pays the company $\$P$. Then
if the customer dies within one year, the company
pays the customer's estate $\$100,000$ but keeps the $\$P$.
If the customer survives, the company pays the customer nothing, and again
keeps the $\$P$. What is the {\em minimum} amount $P$ the
company should charge the customer in order
for the company to profit? In other words, what is the minimum
$P$ for which the expected proceeds of the company will be positive?

\question[12]
Suppose that a woman has genotype $cC$
and her husband has genotype $cc$ for a
genetically inherited trait.
If they decide to become parents,
what is the probability that their child will
have genotype\dots
\begin{parts}
\part $cc$?
\part $Cc$ or $cC$?
\part $CC$?
\end{parts}

\question[10] If a dart is thown at the square dartboard below,
what is the probability that the dart lands in a shaded region?

\question[10] If a card is randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards, what is the probability that the card
will either be a King or have suit $\varheart$?

\question[10] If the odds against a golfer winning a match
are $7:2$ what is the probability that she will win?

\question[10] $37\%$ of North Americans have blood type $O+$.
If a North American is selected at random, what are the odds
against this individual having blood type $O+$?

\question[12] To raise money a volleyball team sells 200~raffle tickets
for $\$5$ each. They will randomly select a ticketholder to receive
a prize of $\$150$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the volleyball team.
\end{parts}

\question[10] The results of the first quiz in Math~104 are
shown in the table below. For each possible score, the number
of students receiving that score is shown directly below
the score.
\[\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
\text{Score}&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\hline
\text{Frequency}&4&7&21&54&75&53
\end{array}\]
Calculate the empirical probability that a randomsly
selected Math~104 student will score $7$ or higher
on the first quiz.
