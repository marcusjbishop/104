Playing poker with your friends,
you have just been dealt
$J\heartsuit,J\clubsuit,J\spadesuit,5\heartsuit,10\spadesuit$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you discard $5\heartsuit$ what is the probability
that you wind up with a full house?\\
{\bf Answer:} $\frac{3}{47}\approx 0.0638$
\item If you discard $5\heartsuit$ what is the probability
that you wind up with four-of-a-kind?\\
{\bf Answer:} $\frac{1}{47}\approx 0.0213$
\item If you discard both $5\heartsuit$ and $10\spadesuit$
what is the probability that you wind up with four-of-a-kind?\\
{\bf Answer:} $\frac{46}{\ncr{47}{2}}=\frac{46}{1081}\approx 0.0426$
\item If you discard both $5\heartsuit$ and $10\spadesuit$
what is the probability that you wind up with a full house?
({\bf Hint:} Three fives and three
tens remain unknown to you, so your full house could be formed
with two fives or two tens, although the number of ways
to draw two fives or two tens is different than the number
of ways to draw two of anything else.)\\
{\bf Answer:} There are $\ncr{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose
two fives and $\ncr{3}{2}=3$ ways to choose two tens.
For each of the ten remaining ranks ($A,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,Q,K$)
there are $\ncr{4}{2}=6$ ways to choose two cards of that rank.
Thus you complete your full house with probability
$\frac{3+3+10\cdot 6}{\ncr{47}{2}}=\frac{66}{1081}\approx 0.0611$.
\item If you discard $J\clubsuit,J\spadesuit,10\spadesuit$
what is the probability you wind up with a flush?\\
{\bf Answer:} $\frac{\ncr{11}{3}}{\ncr{47}{3}}\approx 0.0102$
\item Considering all the calculations above, would you be better
off discarding
$5\heartsuit$,
discarding $5\heartsuit,10\spadesuit$, or
discarding $J\clubsuit,J\spadesuit,10\spadesuit$?\\
{\bf Answer:} 
If you discard only $5\heartsuit$ your probability
of improving your hand is $\frac{3}{47}+\frac{1}{47}=\frac{4}{47}
\approx 0.0851$.
If you discard $5\heartsuit,10\spadesuit$ your probability
of improving your hand is $\frac{46}{1081}+\frac{66}{1081}
=\frac{112}{1081}\approx 0.0136$.
If you discard $J\clubsuit,J\spadesuit,10\spadesuit$
your probability of improving your hand is approximately $0.0102$.
Therefore your best bet is to discard only $5\heartsuit$.
\end{enumerate}
