The following questions involve the game of blackjack,
with the dealer dealing from several decks of cards.
You may therefore assume that $\frac{1}{52}$ is the probability
of being dealt any particular card, irrespective of any cards
known to have already been dealt. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item You received the cards $9\clubsuit,6\diamondsuit$
initially. What is the probability you will bust if
you request another card?
\item You received the cards $K\heartsuit,8\diamondsuit$
initially. What is the probability you will bust if
you request another card?
\item Suppose your cards total $18$ and you decide to stand.
What is the probability you will win the game?
\item Suppose your cards total $20$ and you decide to stand.
What is the probability you will win the game?
\item A {\em royal hand} consists of a king and a queen
of the same suit. Compute the probability of being
dealt a royal hand in the first two cards.
\item Calculate the probability of receiving two
cards adding up to exactly $20$.
\end{enumerate}
