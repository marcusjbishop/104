You have just been dealt
$J\heartsuit,J\clubsuit,J\spadesuit,5\heartsuit,10\spadesuit$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If you discard $5\heartsuit$ what is the probability
that you wind up with a full house?
\item If you discard $5\heartsuit$ what is the probability
that you wind up with four-of-a-kind?
\item If you discard both $5\heartsuit$ and $10\spadesuit$
what is the probability that you wind up with four-of-a-kind?
\item If you discard both $5\heartsuit$ and $10\spadesuit$
what is the probability that you wind up with a full house?
({\bf Hint:} Three fives and three
tens remain unknown to you, so your full house could be formed
with two fives or two tens, although the number of ways
to draw two fives or two tens is different than the number
of ways to draw two of anything else.)
\end{enumerate}
