\uplevel{Fair ticket price}
\question (From exam 1)
To raise money the marching band sells 500~raffle tickets
for $\$3$ each. They will randomly select a ticket holder to receive
a prize of $\$200$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the band.
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
The fair price $P$ is the price for which the expectation
for the ticket holder is $0$. This can be found by solving
$\left(200-P\right)\frac{1}{500}-P\left(\frac{499}{500}\right)=0$
for $P$, which gives $P=\frac{2}{5}$, or 40~cents.
Another way to calculate the fair price
is to add the actual ticket price $\$3$
to the actual expectation $-\$2.60$, which also gives $\$0.40$.
The proceeds for the band are $3\left(\$500\right)-\$200=\$1300$
\end{solution}

\uplevel{Tree diagrams}
\question You need to hire a database administrator
(DBM) and two programmers. You would like to offer the DBM
position to either Alice, Barrett, or Carl and the programming
positions to two of Quinn, Riley, Steven, or Tamara.
However Alice is married to Quinn and the two can only accept
jobs if they are {\em both} offered positions, since they will have
to move if they accept new jobs.
\begin{parts}
\part In how many ways can the jobs be assigned?
\part In how many ways is Alice offered a job?
\part What is the probability that Riley will be offered a job?
\end{parts}

\question You draw a card from a shuffled deck. You don't replace
the card. Then your opponent draws a card. Are the events that
you drew a king and that she drew a king independent?
