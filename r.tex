\uplevel{\bf Fair ticket price}
\question (From exam 1)
To raise money the marching band sells 500~raffle tickets
for $\$3$ each. They will randomly select a ticket holder to receive
a prize of $\$200$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the band.
\end{parts}
\begin{solution}
The fair price $P$ is the price for which the expectation
for the ticket holder is $0$. This can be found by solving
$\left(200-P\right)\frac{1}{500}-P\left(\frac{499}{500}\right)=0$
for $P$, which gives $P=\frac{2}{5}$, or 40~cents.
Another way to calculate the fair price
is to add the actual ticket price $\$3$
to the actual expectation $-\$2.60$, which also gives $\$0.40$.
The proceeds for the band are $3\left(\$500\right)-\$200=\$1300$
\end{solution}

\uplevel{\bf Tree diagrams}
\question You need to hire a database administrator
(DBM) and two programmers. You would like to offer the DBM
position to either Alice, Barrett, or Carl and the programming
positions to two of Quinn, Riley, Steven, or Tamara.
However Alice is married to Quinn and the two can only accept
jobs if they are {\em both} offered positions, since they will have
to move if they accept new jobs.
\begin{parts}
\part In how many ways can the jobs be assigned?
\part In how many ways is Alice offered a job?
\part What is the probability that Riley will be offered a job?
\end{parts}
\uplevel{\bf Counting principle}
\uplevel{\bf Inclusion-exclusion formula (including the form in the case of mutually exclusive events)}
\uplevel{\bf Venn diagrams}
\uplevel{\bf Independence}
\question You draw a card from a shuffled deck. You don't replace
the card. Then your opponent draws a card. Are the events that
you drew a king and that she drew a king independent?
\question You draw a card from a shuffled deck. You don't replace
the card. Then your opponent draws a card. Are the events that
you drew a king and that she drew a heart independent?
\question You roll a regular six-sided die twice. Calculate
the probability that you roll a 1 or 2 the first time and a
3, 4, 5, or 6 the second time.
\begin{solution} The probability of rolling 1 or 2 the first
time is $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.
The probability of rolling 3, 4, 5, or 6 the second time
is $\frac{4}{6}=\frac{2}{3}$.
Since the two events are independent, the probability of both
events occurring is $\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{2}{3}=\frac{2}{9}$. \end{solution}

\uplevel{\bf Craps (including the rules and the calculation
of the probabilities of the various outcomes)}
\question Do the pass bettors or the don't pass bettors have
a greater probability of winning, or are the probabilities the same?
\question Suppose you are the shooter and you roll four on your opening
roll. What is the probability you will win the game?

\uplevel{\bf Union, intersection, size}
\question If $E=\left\{\alpha,\gamma,\zeta\right\}$,
$F=\left\{\alpha,\beta,\delta,\xi\right\}$, and
$G=\left\{\beta,\zeta,\xi\right\}$, then calculate the following.
\begin{parts}
\part $E\cap F$
\part $E\cup G$
\part $\left|E\cup\left(F\cap G\right)\right|$
\end{parts}

\uplevel{\bf Conditional probability}
\question Your opponent draws a card from a shuffled deck. She doesn't
replace the card. Then you draw a card. Calculate the following.
\begin{parts}
\part The probability that you draw a queen given that she drew a queen.
\begin{solution} $\frac{3}{51}$ \end{solution}
\part The probability that she drew a queen and you drew a queen.
\begin{solution} $\frac{4}{52}\cdot\frac{3}{51}=\frac{1}{221}$ \end{solution}
\part The probability that you draw a heart given that she drew a queen.
\begin{solution} This is impossible to calculate without knowing
whether she drew the card $Q\heartsuit$. \end{solution}
\end{parts}

\question\label{Spinner} Suppose the sample space of an experiment
consists of three independent
outcomes $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$ and that
$P\left(\omega_1\right)=\frac{2}{7}$, $P\left(\omega_2\right)=\frac{1}{7}$,
and $P\left(\omega_3\right)=\frac{4}{7}$. Consider the events
$E=\left\{\omega_1,\omega_2\right\}$ and $F=\left\{\omega_2\right\}$.
Calculate $P\left(E\mid\text{not $F$}\right)$.
\begin{multicols}{2}
\question A spinner for a game is shown at the left
Calculate the probability that the spinner will stop
on a primary color given that it does not stop on an ISU color.
\begin{center}\includegraphics[scale=.6]{ReviewSpinner}\end{center}
\end{multicols}
\begin{solution} This is the same problem as Exercise~\ref{Spinner}
with $E$ the event that the spinner lands on a primary
color and $F$ the event that the spinner lands on an ISU color.
\end{solution}.

\question You roll two regular two-sided dice. Calculate the probability
that the sum of the numbers showing is greater than 9 given that
the first die shows 5.
\begin{solution} The sum will be greater than 9 if the second die
shows 5 or 6. This will occur with probability $\frac{2}{6}=\frac{1}{3}$.
\end{solution}

\uplevel{\bf Permutations }
\question In a swimming race involving eight swimmers, only the three
with the fastest times are observed, namely, first, second, third places.
How many possible outcomes of the race are there?
\begin{solution} $8\cdot 7\cdot 6=336$ \end{solution}
\question A {\em byte} is a sequence of eight {\em bits}, each
of which representing either zero or one. How many bytes are possible?
\begin{solution} $2^8=256$\end{solution}

\question How many subsets of a set of size ten are there?
