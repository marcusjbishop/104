\begin{questions}

\question[12] The French roulette wheel has
slots labeled by the numbers $0$--$36$. 
The ball is equally likely to stop in any slot.
Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as in the American wheel discussed in class.
\begin{parts}
\part A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses the $\$1$. Calculate the expected
proceeds on this bet.
\part More generally, players can bet any amount that the ball stops on any
of $n$~chosen numbers. If the ball stops on one of those $n$~slots
the casino pays the player $\frac{36}{n}-1$ times
the player's bet. Otherwise the player loses the bet. If a player
bets $\$1$ that the ball will land on a slot
labeled by an odd number, calculate
the expected proceeds of the bet.
\end{parts}

\question[8] If the odds against a golfer winning a match
are $7:2$ what is the probability that she will win?

\question[10] A die is rolled. Determine the odds
against each of the following events.
\begin{parts}
\part The result is $5$
\part The result is less than $5$
\part The result is odd
\end{parts}

\question[10] The results of the first quiz in Math~104 are
shown in the table below. For each possible score, the number
of students receiving that score is shown directly below
the score.
\[\begin{array}{c|ccccccc}
\text{Score}&5&6&7&8&9&10\\\hline
\text{Frequency}&4&7&21&54&75&53
\end{array}\]
Calculate the empirical probability that a randomly
selected Math~104 student will score $7$ or higher
on the first quiz.

\question[10]
Suppose that a woman has genotype $cC$
and her husband has genotype $cc$ for a
genetically inherited trait.
If they decide to become parents, calculate the
probability that their child will
have the following genotypes.
\begin{parts}
\part $cc$
\part either $Cc$ or $cC$
\part $CC$
\end{parts}

\question[12] An insurance company sells a $\$100,000$
life insurance policy for $\$P$. 
In other words, a customer pays the company $\$P$;
if the customer dies within one year, the company
pays the customer's estate $\$100,000$ but keeps the $\$P$;
if the customer survives, the company pays the customer nothing, and again
keeps the $\$P$. 
Suppose that the probability of a $30$~year old woman surviving
for one year is $0.985$.
What is the {\em minimum} amount $P$ the
company should charge her for a  $\$100,000$ life
insurance policy in order
for the company to profit in the long run?

\question[8] $38\%$ of the population of Belgium has blood type $O+$.
If a Belgian is selected at random, what are the odds
against this individual having blood type $O+$?

\question[10] If a card is randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards, what is the probability that the card
will either be a picture card or have suit $\varheart$?
A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King.

\question[10]
\begin{multicols}{2}
If a dart is thrown at the square dart board shown at the right,
what is the probability that the dart lands in a shaded region?\\

\question[10] To raise money the volleyball team sells 500~raffle tickets
for $\$3$ each. They will randomly select a ticket holder to receive
a prize of $\$150$.
\begin{parts}
\part Calculate the fair ticket price.
\part Calculate the expected proceeds for the volleyball team.
\end{parts}
