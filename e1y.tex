\question[12] An insurance company sells a $\$100,000$
life insurance policy for $\$P$. 
In other words, a customer pays the company $\$P$;
if the customer dies within one year, then the company
pays the customer's estate $\$100,000$ but keeps the $\$P$;
if the customer survives, then
the company pays the customer nothing and keeps the $\$P$. 
Suppose that the probability of a $30$~year old woman surviving
for one year is $0.975$.
What is the {\em minimum} amount $P$ the
company should charge her for a  $\$100,000$ life
insurance policy in order
for the company to profit in the long run?

\question[10] If a card is randomly selected from a deck
of playing cards, what is the probability that the card
will either be a picture card or have a red suit?
A {\em picture card} is either a Jack, Queen, or King
and a {\em red} suit is either $\varheart$ or $\vardiamond$.

\question[12] The French roulette wheel has
slots labeled by the numbers $0$--$36$. 
The ball is equally likely to stop in any slot.
Note that there is no slot labeled
$00$ as on the American wheel discussed in class.
\begin{parts}
\part A player chooses a slot and bets $\$1$ that the ball lands on
that slot. If it does, the casino pays the player $\$35$.
Otherwise the player loses $\$1$. Calculate the expected
proceeds of this bet.
\part More generally, players can bet any amount 
of money that the ball stops on any
of $n$~chosen numbers. If the ball stops on one of those $n$~slots
the casino pays the player $\frac{36}{n}-1$ times
the player's bet. Otherwise the player loses the money bet. If a player
bets $\$1$ that the ball will land on a slot
labeled by one of the numbers $17,18,20,21$, calculate
the expected proceeds of the bet.
